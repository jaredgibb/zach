                                          The No Surprises Act is a federal law that took effect January 1, 2022, and provides protections
                                          against surprise medical bills.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Good Faith Estimate</h3>
                                    <p>
                                          Under the law, healthcare providers need to give patients who don't have insurance or who are not using
                                          insurance an estimate of the bill for medical items and services.
                                    </p>
